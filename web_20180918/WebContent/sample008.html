	HTML Formatting Elements
	In the previous chapter, you learned about the HTML style attribute.

	HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning.
	
	HTML uses elements like <b> and <i> for formatting output, like bold or italic text.

	Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

	<b> - Bold text
	<strong> - Important text
	<i> - Italic text
	<em> - Emphasized text
	<mark> - Marked text
	<small> - Small text
	<del> - Deleted text
	<ins> - Inserted text
	<sub> - Subscript text
	<sup> - Superscript text
	 -->
	 
	 This text is bold
	 <sup>This text is bold</sup>
	 <sub>This text is bold</sub>
